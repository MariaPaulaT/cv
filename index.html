    <p><em>Software engineering student. Software Development intern at Accenture.</em></p>
    <p>I am Maria Paula Tellez, a systems and computer engineer from the <strong><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidad_de_los_Andes_(Colombia)">University of Los Andes </a> </strong>in Colombia. With my strong educational background in computer engineering, I have taken my skills to the next level as a software developer intern at Accenture. My passion for technology  led me to also serve as a teaching assistant for a mobile app building class. I use my expertise to guide students in their learning journey and share my passion for technology with them. In my free time, I enjoy keeping fit and healthy by going to the gym.</p></td>
